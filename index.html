                <p>I am a <strong><span>Responsive Front-end Web Developer</span></strong> who thrives on visual storytelling and the best user experience. When I'm not hard at work, pursuing side projects or continuing my education, you can find me painting, working on my novel, or rocking some music while playing with my dogs.</p>

            <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                <p> I was born in Milwaukee, but my family moved before my 5th birthday out to Salt Lake City in time for me to begin kindergarten, only to return to WI after I graduated from high school. Utah is a gorgeous state with many national parks. My mother's love of <span>going for a ride</span> made me love traveling around on day trips to see the world. Whenever I travel, I prefer driving over flying because I'm free to go where I want, when I want, and I get to see some amazing country in the process. Best trip? Driving from Milwaukee to Alaska, and back again. Fantastic time and done in just two and a half weeks with a stop-over in Glacier Natl. Park.</p>

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>One of my passions is <span>MUSIC!</span> Most people would never guess that I am a hard rock and heavy metal rocker, but I am! I also enjoy other types of music as well. When not rocking out, I'm partial to the '70s music from my childhood, and movie scores. My favorite band is <strong>Apocalyptica</strong>. This Finnish group consists of three classically trained cellists and a drummer. They don't have a singer but often collaborate with singers in different bands. They are amazing! I have traveled to see them in other states many times, and I would highly recommend that you go see them in concert if you have the opportunity. They have even made me a lover of opera.</p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p>When I was young, I wanted to be an artist and writer. As life and work took up most of my time,  I had stepped away from both for a while. Recently, I have delved back in and rekindled those flames. I love painting, as well as capturing moments through photography. I have written a novel, and although it has been in the editing process for a while, I do hope to have it published someday. I have to! I have several other solid stories milling about in my head, so I have to make time to work on all of them. Maybe I'll even get some new poetry written too. I love getting those creative juices flowing again and working on websites is lighting more creative fires in me.</p>
